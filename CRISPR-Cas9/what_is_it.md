# CRISPR/Cas9

<b> clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) </b>

- gene-editing tech 
  - making it possible to correct errors in the genome
  - turn on/off genes in cells/organisms quickly and cheaply

- applications
  - lab applications: rapid generation of cellular/animal models
    - functional genomic screens
    - live imaging of the cellular genome
  - has been demonstrated to repair defective DNA in mice to cure
    them of genetic disorders
      - human embryos can be modified similarly
  - other clinical applications:
    - gene therapy
    - treating infectious diseases like HIV
    - engineering autologous patient material to treat cancer and other diseases

## Overview
<br>

Comprised of 2 main components:
  1. guide RNA to match desired target gene
  2. Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) - endonuclease which causes a double stranded DNA break
     allowing for modifications in genome
