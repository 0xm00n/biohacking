# Cell-Free Protein Synthesis

Also known as in vitro protein synthesis or CFPS. It is the production of protein using biological machinery in a cell-free system (without the use of living cells).

<br>

the in vitro protein synthesis environment: 
- not constrained by cell wall or homeostasis conditions necessary to maintain cell viability
  - because of this, CFPS enables direct access/control of the translation environment

<br>

### Common Components (Cell-Free Reaction)
- cell extract
- energy source 
- supply of amino acids
- cofactors (ex. magnesium)
- DNA w/ desired genes

<br>

### Cell Extract
A cell extract is obtained by lysing the cell and centrifuging out the cell walls, DNA genome, and other debris. What remains is the necessary cell machinery
which includes ribosomes, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, translation initiation/elongation factors, nucleases, etc.
