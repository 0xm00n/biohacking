# Synthetic Biology

SynBio is an area of research that seeks to create new biological parts, devices, and systems or to redesign systems already in nature.

<br>

SynBio has a very loose definition which can encompass: 
- use of a mix of physical engineering and genetic engineering to create new (synthetic) lifeforms
- emerging field of research that aims to combine knowledge/methods of biology, engineering, and related disciplines in the design of 
  chemically synthesized DNA to create organisms with novel or enhanced characteristics/traits
- applying the engineering paradigm of systems design to biological systems in order to produce predictable and robust systems with 
  novel functionalities that do not exist in nature

### Approaches
1. <b> Top Down </b>: involves metabolic and genetic engineering techniques to impart new functions to living cells
2. <b> Bottom Up </b>: involves creating new biological systems in an artificial environment by bringing together non-living 
              biomolecular components, often with the goal of constructing an artificial cell

### Biological Systems
Biological systems are assembled module by module. <b> Cell-free protein expression systems </b> are often employed as well as <b> membrane-based molecular machinery </b>
